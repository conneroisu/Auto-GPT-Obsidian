## Introduction 

The AutoGPT GitHub project refers to a project hosted on the GitHub platform that aims to develop and implement Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT). GPT models are a type of artificial intelligence model designed for natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and question-answering.

It provides access to a wide range of open-source projects and repositories, among which the AutoGPT project could potentially be found. However, it is important to note that there is no official AutoGPT project from OpenAI. The AutoGPT project can be best described as an early attempt at autonomous AI system develop open-source that sets it's own tasks and goals. Instead of a single company holding your future in its hands, Auto-GPT is pushing for the best, autonomous AI assistant for every device for every person. In the near future, we want you to be able to accomplish more everyday. With the help of the incredible open-source community, AutoGPT making approximately a monthâ€™s progress every 48 hours. To simplify, with the posibility of over-simplifying, AutoGPT is an experimental open-source attempt to make GPT-4 fully autonomous.
